   The goal of the game is to enjoy a walk in the woods.
   As you walk, you pick up little bits and bobs. 
   At the end of the game, you may be able to craft some of your findings into a gift for your friend.
   
   Cloth, button, string and thimble make a Cute Dress.
      - If you do not have the thimble, you can still make the dress, but you'll receive a note
      that an extra something might have made your thumbs hurt less.
      - If you do not have the button, you can still make the dress, but you'll receive a note 
      that an extra something might have added some fine detail.
      
   Apple, carrot, and onion make a Yummy Soup.
      -If you are missing one of the ingredients, you can still make a soup, but you'll receive
      a note that an extra ingredient would have made the soup sing.
      
   FLower, Honey, and Acorn (or Thimble) make Cup of Tea.
      -You may gather either the acorn or the thimble to use for the cup.
      -If you are missing honey, you can still make tea, but you'll receive a note that an
      extra something could have made the tea a little sweeter.
